                            This piece was written for a former student who competed in the AACS Music Competition and won first place in 2018.  I have blah blah blah stuff more stuff...

                            I have always admired the music of Eric Sammut.  I was in the audience at PASIC 2009 when he premiered the <i>Three Spirals</i>, and later performed them on a recital at Indiana Univesity.  It has been a pleasure to revisit these pieces after so long.  The Spirals are connected both thematically and harmonically, but each takes on its own character.

                            Daniel Cathey and I were classmates at Wichita State University.  He wrote this piece during his sophomore year, and I was always captivated by the nostalgic feeling the piece evokes.

                            <i>Merlin</i> was written for marimbist William Moersch in 1987.  It is inspired by the poem <i>Merlin</i> by Robert Something.  The piece is divided into two movements, which draw inspiration from the following quotes, which are meant to set the mood for each section of the piece:<br><br>
                            I. Gawaine!  Blah Blah Blah!<br><br>
